Welcome to spark, a stupid 1-D ALI code for doing radiative transfer.

Dependencies:
    - C++ compiler
        - I've used gcc 4.7.2, clang 3.0, and Intel 12.1.
    - Boost
        - You need >= 1.53.0, because this was the version that incorporated
          the Odeint project.
    - Autotools
        - autoconf >= 2.69
        - automake >= 1.11

Optional dependencies:
    - HDF5 > 1.8.9
        - The line list construction utility requires HDF5, but spark itself
          can both compile and run without it.
