Welcome to spark, a stupid 1-D ALI code for doing radiative transfer.

Dependencies:
    - C++ compiler
    - Fortran compiler
    - Boost
    - yaml-cpp
    - odeint-v2 (currently part of the Boost sandbox)
    - CMake
    - HDF5

To avoid all the headaches associated with letting this code try to find those
libraries/headers automatically, you must also set the following environment
variables:
    - YAML_DIR
    - ODEINT_DIR
    - BOOST_DIR
    - GSL_DIR
    - HDF_DIR
