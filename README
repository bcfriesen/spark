Welcome to spark, a stupid 1-D ALI code for doing radiative transfer.

Dependencies:
    - C++ compiler
        - I've used gcc 4.7.2, clang 3.0, and Intel 12.1.
    - Boost
        - You need >= 1.53.0, because this was the version that incorporated
          the Odeint project.
    - Autotools
        - autoconf >= 2.69
        - automake >= 1.11

Optional dependencies:
    - HDF5 > 1.8.9
        - The line list construction utility requires HDF5, but spark itself
          can both compile and run without it.


Compiling instructions:

This code uses the GNU Autotools build system, so you must have reasonably
modern versions of autoconf, automake, etc.

If your compiler doesn't automatically know where your Boost library headers
are, you need to tell 'configure' where they are using

    ./configure --with-boost=<dir>

where '<dir>' is the top level of your Boost library, i.e., the name of the
folder where you unpacked the tarball. The parts of Boost that this code uses
are entirely header-based, so you don't need to compile Boost at all - just
unpack the headers, tell the compiler where they are, and off you go. Boost is
a very cutting-edge library and is quite demanding on your C++ compiler
(although the Boost developers go to great lengths to make it as widely
compatible as possible). This means you probably can't run this code on your
15-year-old IBM RS/6000. Sorry.
