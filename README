Welcome to spark, a stupid 1-D ALI code for doing radiative transfer.

Dependencies:
    - C++ compiler
        - I've used gcc 4.7.2, clang 3.0, and Intel 12.1.
    - Fortran compiler
        - I've used gfortran 4.7.2 and Intel 12.1.
    - Boost
        - I've used > 1.49.0.
    - yaml-cpp
        - The API changed in 0.5.0; currently spark only works with the old API
          in 0.3.0.
    - odeint-v2
        - This project has been accepted into the Boost library but still has
          not been included as of Boost 1.52.0.
    - CMake
        - I've used > 2.8.
    - HDF5
        - I've used > 1.8.9.

To avoid all the headaches associated with letting this code try to find those
libraries/headers on your machine automatically, you must also set the following
environment variables:
    - YAML_DIR
    - ODEINT_DIR
    - BOOST_DIR
    - GSL_DIR
    - HDF_DIR
